Fork of the [PearPC](https://github.com/sebastianbiallas/pearpc) emulator, modified to be compiled to WebAssembly and run in the browser. Part of the [Infinite Mac](https://github.com/mihaip/infinite-mac), see [its README](https://github.com/mihaip/infinite-mac/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

It is also possible to run the native build of PearPC on modern macOS on Apple Silicon:

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make -j8
src/ppc path/to/PearPC.cfg
```
